print('hello %s' % name)  # this returns --> hello Bob
print('hello %s your regno is %d' % (name, regno))  # --> hello Bob your regno is 25689
# if making more than one sub put them in a tuple and put the operator outside it like this %(sub1, sub2)

# convert to hexadecimal
print('%d in hexadecimal is %x' % (errno, errno))  # --> 50159747054 in hexadecimal is badc0ffee

# another crazy style that helps you ignore order using keywords
print('hey %(n)s you have a %(e)x' % {'e': errno, 'n': name})  # --> hey Bob you have a badc0ffee

# String Formatting Using The String Format Method
# when using numbers to indicate a position start with zero and increase accordingly
print('my name is {0} I am {1} years old'.format('Samuel', 24))  # --> my name is Samuel I am 24 years old

# Using empty braces. Put the arguments in the format method as you want them to appear.
print('my name is {} I am {} years old'.format('Samuel', 24))  # --> my name is Samuel I am 24 years old

# using keywords. when using keywords arguments in the format method can be in any other
print('my name is {name} I am {age} years old'.format(name='Samuel', age=24))  # --> my name is Samuel I am 24 years old

# Arguments can be literals or variables and you can mix positional with keywords
#  as long as all the positional comes first
print('my name is {} I am {age} years old'.format(name, age=24))  # --> my name is Bob I am 24 years old

# Format specifier.
# Format specifiers come in this order.  [fill][align][sign][#][0][width][,][.precision][type]
# Fill. this can be any character other than '{' or '}'

# Align includes the following
# '<' which forces the field character to be left aligned within the available space
# '>' which forces the field character to be right aligned within the available space
# '=' this forces padding to be placed after the sign before the digits. only for numeric use e.g. +234
# '^' forces the field character to be centered within the available space
# the number after the sign indicates the available space

print('this is left {:<10} and this is right {:>10} while this is center {:^10} alongside this {:=+10}'.format(10, 10, 10, +17))


# Sign includes the following
# '+' indicates that a sign should be used for both negative and positive numbers
# '-' indicates that a minus sign should be used for negative numbers but none for positive numbers
# ' ' empty space indicates that a space should be use for positive numbers and minus sign for positive numbers
print('show the signs for this {:+} and {:+} but use space for this {: } and this {: } the default is {:-} and this'
	  ' {:-} but let us try this {} and this {}'.format(2, -2, 2, -2, 2, -2, 2, -2))


# "#" is used for number conversion
# 'b' is for binary conversion
# 'o' is for octal conversion
# 'c' is for character conversion. it converts an integer to the corresponding unicode character
# 'd' is for decimal conversion
# 'x' is for hexadecimal conversion with small letters
# 'X' is for hexadecimal conversion with big letters
# 'n' same as d but uses locale default to choose separator
# 'e' prints number in scientific notation using 'e'
# 'E' prints number in scientific notation using 'E'
# 'f' and 'F' displays the number as fixed point display 'F' displays inf, nan as INF, NAN
# 'G' and 'g' this is the general formats. displays number according to level of precision indicated and uses 'e' or 'E' when necessary
# '%' multiplies the number by 100
